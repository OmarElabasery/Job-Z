## ⚠️ About Missing Files (Unity Project & Demo Build)

The **full Unity project**, including all assets, scenes, materials, scripts, and build files, is **not included** in this repository.

### Why isn't it included?

Unity projects are extremely large (multiple gigabytes) due to:

- High-resolution textures  
- Lighting and shader caches  
- VR and Desktop build artifacts  
- Unity package dependencies  
- Large 3D models and materials  

GitHub is not suitable for hosting such large files and would cause performance issues and exceed size limits.

### What about the demo?

The **Desktop demo build** and **VR demo build** are also **not uploaded** for the same size-related reasons.
