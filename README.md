## ⚠️ About Missing Unity Project Files

The **full Unity project** (including assets, scenes, shaders, and build files) is **not included** in this repository.

### Why is it missing?

Unity projects are extremely large (multiple GBs), and GitHub is not suitable for storing:

- Large texture files  
- Build artifacts  
- Shaders and lighting maps  
- VR/desktop build folders  
- Unity packages  

Uploading the complete project would exceed GitHub's limits and cause slow repository performance.

### Need the full project?

I can provide:

- A **Google Drive link** containing the Unity project  
- A **Windows executable** (desktop demo)  
- A **VR demo**  
- A **video walkthrough**

Just reach out!

## 🎥 Demo

A short video demonstration of booth interactions, movement, and platform features is available in the `/demo` folder.

Full VR or desktop builds are available upon request.

## 🧑‍💻 My Role

I contributed to and led multiple aspects of the project:

- System design and booth interaction logic  
- Database integration (SQL Server)  
- Backend logic using C# / .NET  
- UI/UX specification in collaboration with designers  
- Coordination across development and 3D modeling efforts  

This project reflects my interest in combining **interactive systems**, **design**, and **software engineering**.
